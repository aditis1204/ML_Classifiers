# ML_Classifiers
In this Nootebook we used attrition dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shala2020/shala2020.github.io/master/Lecture_Materials/Assignments/MachineLearning/L1/attrition.csv
this site.
- Implemented various classifier, which can predict the Attrition for the employees.
- Before implementing any model, we will have to apply suitable encoding to the features and implement exploratory data analysis to know our data better.
- we can either define our own custom-made classifer or select classifier(s) available in the scikit-learn.
- Here I implemented a three classifiers (e.g. RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier) and evaluate which one is giving the best peformance.
- For each of the classifier, reported the accuracy, precision, recall, roc curve, etc.
